Summary:
This paper introduced a method that imporves the human behavior predictive accuracy of Social Force Model (SFM) under the discrete events like pedestrain moving.

Method:
The paper introduced an experiment firstly using video and audio devices to collect human bahaviors data. Then categorize them by applying the statistical model on human behavior analysis.
And finally use these data as parameters of SFM to predict human behaviors.

Note:
The Social Force Model (SFM) is an predict model that analyze the human behavior by using physical kinetic and dynamic simulations. It can predict human behavior on a contineous flow of motion
since the limitation of physical laws. However, it lack of ability to handle the short, discrete events of human behavior.
