* Pneumatics *

P1 in back => A1 A2 B1 B2
P2 in back Direct port
No exhaust for clean room model


* Controller outputs *
UserIO
  Outputs work in manual mode (1, 2 on pendant toggle outputs 0 and 1)
BasicIO (3-8ms processing in HW, software sync at 4ms)
  16 inputs/outputs
FaultIO
FastIO (50 us processing in HW)
  latch mechanism that records feedback (?) config in register, updated 200us
  readLatch()
  SECTEUR_OK - loss of power to auxiliary power 195V, 80-90ms until reset
    file access will be halted on a brownout
RsiIO, CpuIO (temperature sensors)
  RSI ~ 10 + room  (caution > 40)
  CPU ~ 20 + room  (caution > 50)
  clean out controller ports
EncoderIO (external encoder input on card)

Sockets can be created
  Client actual IP, port, etc
  Server port, etc, # of clients (max 4)
    losing connection: up to 30 seconds before socket closed

2 serial ports (not in emulator)


* Programming I/O *
Read into library io:bIn0
dioLink/sioLink
aioGet/aioSet 
IO not changed until end of program slice
sioGet/sioSet (see cognex camera, ATI force sensor examples)


* Motion Addon *
Carried part moves
Velocity commands:
  setCartPosAccel?
  velFrame, velJoint, velTool, setVelCmd
Calibration
  setOffset
  setDH (needs 6axisAbosluteRobot)
Forget drv* stuff
Feedforward
  alterAtc, getFeedForward
Boxcar delay? internal filter in servo system for commanded positions
getJntPosRef- command before the boxcar filter. herej is after boxcar
getJntForce - forces applied by motor (standard now)
getDrvForce - doesn't take into account gearing
addInertia/setInertia - 
setMaxJntVel/Tvel
setFriction
setBoxcarFreq

FTP motion.o file onto the controller in sys/app/
Flash drive partitions: sys, log, usr
Executables: into SRS and emulator

VxWorks 5.4?
