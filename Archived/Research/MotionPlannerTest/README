Motion planning test files
Kris Hauser

Contains code for playing with and visualizing planners. 

Requires KrisLibrary, which requires tinyxml and optionally Assimp.

The main.cpp program can launch a bunch of sandbox programs, which are fairly
poorly organized right now.

The Plan program (plan.cpp) lets you plan for point robots and planar rigid
robots using a variety of motion planners.  You can visualize plans and
roadmaps or just run tests from the command line.

The KlamptPlan program (klamptplan.cpp) lets you plan for Klamp't robots.
You can visualize plans and roadmaps or just run tests from the command line.
Requires Klampt.
