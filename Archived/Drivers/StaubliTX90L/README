C++ and Python client code for interfacing with the Staubli CS8C controllers.

There are two versions, 1 and 3.  The same server version must be run on the
CS8C as the client version.

Version 1 (TrajClient) works with piecewise linear paths and operates with
relative times.  It is a bit easier to program with, but is much harder to
do hard real-time trajectory updates.

Version 3 (TrajClient3) works with Hermite spline paths and operates with
absolute times.  It is a bit harder to program with, because you must
synchronize your commands to the clock of the controller, but it does allow
hard real-time trajectory updates.
